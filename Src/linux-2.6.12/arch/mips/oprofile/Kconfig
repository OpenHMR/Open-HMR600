config PROFILING
	bool "Profiling support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
	  by profilers such as OProfile.


config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PROFILING && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config VENUS_OPROFILE_CLOCK
	bool "Use Venus CPU clock for oprofile"
	depends on OPROFILE && PROFILING && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Use Venus's CPU clock to drive oprofile, instead of the default
	  scheduler timer interrupt. The CPU clock can drive sampling rate
	  at 2500 (default, changable) per second, compared to 100 sampling
	  per second (fixed) for default timer.

config VENUS_OPROFILE_FREQ
	int "Venus oprofile sampling frequency" 
	depends on VENUS_OPROFILE_CLOCK
	default "2500"
	help
	   Sampling frequency of Oprofile using Venus internal clock.

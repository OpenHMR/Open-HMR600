	  Support for USB 1.1 and 2.0 DVB-T devices based on reference designs made by
	  DiBcom (http://www.dibcom.fr) and C&E.

	  Devices supported by this driver:
	    Realtek DVB-T USB (RTL2830/RTL2831U)

	  These devices can be understood as budget ones, they "only" deliver
	  (a part of) the MPEG2 transport stream.

	  A firmware is needed to get the device working. See Documentation/dvb/README.dibusb
	  details.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it. You should build it as
	  a module.
